                                CFD Code for Plasma & Reactive Flow

  _______________________________________________________________________________________________


  CFDWARP is a 100,000+ line C code that is specifically tailored to simulate efficiently plasma 
  and reactive flows occurring in aerodynamics, combustion, hypersonics, re-entry, lightning, 
  and fuel reforming. CFDWARP is a high-order compressible flow solver that uses 
  state-of-the-art flux discretization schemes suitable for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes 
  (RANS) and Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES). CFDWARP is superior to other non-neutral 
  plasma codes in two ways:
 
  (a) CFDWARP is the first CFD code that integrates the electron and ion equations along with 
      the bulk flow equations using aerodynamic-scale (i.e. microsecond and higher) integration 
      steplengths, permitting the simulation of non-neutral plasmas in about the same amount of 
      computing effort as non-ionized reactive flows (see https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054624).
      
  (b) CFDWARP is the first implicit solver for gas dynamics that preserves the positivity of 
      the partial densities and of the pressure, permitting the integration of chemically-
      reacting flows in which a vacuum form such as blast waves or lightning (see
      https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.01.046)
