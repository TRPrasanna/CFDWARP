                                CFD Code for Plasma & Reactive Flow

  _______________________________________________________________________________________________


  CFDWARP is a 100,000+ line C code that is specifically tailored to simulate efficiently plasma 
  and reactive flows occurring in aerodynamics, combustion, hypersonics, re-entry, lightning, 
  and fuel reforming. CFDWARP is a high-order compressible flow solver that uses 
  state-of-the-art flux discretization schemes and that is superior to other non-neutral plasma 
  codes in two ways:
 
  (a) CFDWARP is the first CFD code that integrates the electron and ion equations along with 
      the "bulk flow" equations using aerodynamic-scale (i.e. microsecond and higher) 
      integration steplengths (see https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054624).
      
  (b) CFDWARP is the first implicit solver for gas dynamics that preserves the positivity of 
      the partial densities and of the pressure (see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.01.046).
