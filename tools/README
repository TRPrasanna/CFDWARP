2. SHELL SCRIPTS


average.sh                   reads the data from various input files and outputs the 
                             averaged values to an output file

countlines.sh                counts the number of lines of code in all files with a 
                             given extension in all subdirectories recursively

                             UNLESS YOU ARE THE CFDWARP MAINTAINER]

gitnewversion_public.sh      creates a new version (a new tag) of the non-proprietary 
                             modules of CFDWARP on github [DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU ARE
                             THE CFDWARP MAINTAINER]

gitpull.sh                   downloads latest CFDWARP using git

indentwithwarpstyle.sh       automatically indents a C file according to the CFDWARP 
                             style

integrate.sh                 integrates a property on various tecplot post files;
                             the property integrated can be defined by an equation
                             or by a tecplot macro

                             in all files with a specified extension recursively 
                             using either perl or rpl [USE WITH CARE]

search.sh                    a script that lists the files (recursively in all 
                             subdirectories) that contain a certain string  

tarCFDWARP.sh                creates a tarball of the CFDWARP directory
