Alexander, Derrick
  - implementation of the JoinAll2D subroutine in lib/gridgen/2Dbase.c
    and of the JoinAll3D in lib/gridgen/3Dbase.c.

Etele, Jason
  - development of code tools/rocket_v?.c
  - write-up of the documentation tools/doc/Rocket_v?
  - implementation of the axisymmetric source terms in the subroutine
    FindSaxisymmetric in prim/_kpsi/prim.c
  - implementation of the kerosene-related species in
    prim/thermo/_hightemp

Padmanabhan, Sathyan 
  - tools/tauvt.c

Schwartzentruber, Tom
  - implementation of superzone in cycle/share/cycle_share.c part of SHAREDMPI commands
